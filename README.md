# MovieList Vue.js

## About:

To continue my studies in Vue.js, I chose to revisit and enhance a project that I initially developed when I started studying Next.js. This project is a website that consumes the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to display currently popular movies, also providing the functionality to search for movies by name.

Here is the link to the initial version of this project during my Next.js learning phase: [MovieList](https://github.com/Artur-Poffo/MovieList).

## Concepts to study during the project:

- [x] Data fetching
- [x] Further study on routing
- [x] Learn a bit about the different Vue APIs: Options API and Composition API
- [] Dynamic routing
- [x] radix-vue - Vue.js port of Radix UI
- [x] Pinia - state management tool

## Future tasks:

- [] Implement a loading spinner for a smoother user experience
- [] Create a 404 page
- [] Develop a movie page with dynamic routing
